## Project Aim
Analyze video game sales data to identify key trends by genre, platform, release year and region to support future advertising strategies.

## Tools Used
- Python

- pandas, numpy

- matplotlib, seaborn

## Key Results
- The Action genre was the most popular, while PS4 was the top-selling platform.
- User ratings don't differ statistically between Xbox One and PC.
- There is no clear correlation between critic/user scores and game sales, likely due to missing data and varying review availability.
- Game success is influenced by a combination of platform, genre, region, and user sentiment.
